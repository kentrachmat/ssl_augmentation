12163782,Yes. The enhanced migratory response of neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to high concentrations of interleukin-8 may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS.,"These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.",20251020_230451_qwen_baseline_N3296_gpus2

10593212,No. The results of this study suggest that LOC does not predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion.,The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions.

These changes may be important for the regulation of PCD. The results also suggest that the PTP may be involved in the regulation of PCD in this system.,"Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system.

Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful.

An ANN model based on PRISM scores does not improve prediction of LOS.,"The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",20251020_230451_qwen_baseline_N3296_gpus2
