12163782,Yes. Enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.,"These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2

22519710,"No. The power of RCTs to unveil a significant association between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes is critically dependent on a complex interaction among several factors, making it unlikely that clinical studies will definitively elucidate this connection.",Ongoing RCTs may lack enough power to settle the issue of whether or not the transfusion of stored blood has a negative clinical impact. A precautionary reduction of the maximum storage time to 35 days is advisable.,20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
18307476,Yes. Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates among all single elderly individuals.,"Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
9767546,Yes. The presence of both carbohydrate and lipid-derived AGEs in uremic plasma suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to the formation of these adducts.,"These data suggest that the increased levels of AGEs in blood, and probably in tissues, reported in uremia implicate a broad derangement in non-enzymatic biochemistry involving alterations in autoxidation of both carbohydrates and lipids.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
23375036,Yes. The OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens reported high sensitivity and specificity when compared to serum ELISA.,"This testing method may provide a useful strategy for conducting HIV surveillance in possible co-infected TB patients at peripheral centres. Since there is no investment on infrastructure, it may be possible for paramedical health professionals to carry out the test, particularly in areas with low HIV endemicity.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
19409117,Yes. Patients with higher infundibular height have a better chance of being stone-free after SWL.,Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.,20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2

Women with pelvic pain have higher rates of defecatory symptoms such as straining, incomplete emptying, pain during bowel movements, and splinting.","In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
19394934,"Yes. The study found that in 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52, and 79.2% of casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment.",Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.,20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
19648304,"Yes. Sonographic guidance resulted in reduced procedural pain, lower absolute pain scores at the 2-week outcome, fewer patients with significant pain, higher responder rates, and lower nonresponder rates compared to conventional palpation-guided methods.",Sonographic needle guidance significantly improves the performance and outcomes of outpatient IA injections in a clinically significant manner.,20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
18049437,"Yes, past group A streptococcal infection may be associated with multiple sclerosis, as indicated by elevated ADNase B levels in patients with MS compared to healthy controls.","These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2

21801416,Yes. Both metformin and AICAR reduced the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion.,"Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
17715311,Yes. The study found that repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation yielded a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies and a higher rate of neonatal interventions compared to other reasons for follow-up sonography.,"A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.",20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
24142776,No. The study found that betamethasone did not reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin when given together.,Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.,20251021_184447_qwen_semantic_N6593_gpus2
27287237,"Yes. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases, with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively.","Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment.
