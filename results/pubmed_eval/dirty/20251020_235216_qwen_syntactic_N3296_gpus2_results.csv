12163782,Yes. Neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma exhibit an enhanced migratory response to interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission. This finding suggests that the enhanced neutrophil migratory activity may play a role in the pathogenesis of ARDS.,"These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.",20251020_235216_qwen_syntactic_N3296_gpus2

An ANN model based on PRISM scores does not improve prediction accuracy.,"The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS.
