Reactive strength as measured by the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors than influence agility performance should also be considered.",20251021_023427_llama_baseline_N3296_gpus2

The decrease in anterior chamber depth when facing down in eyes with pseudoexfoliation is significantly greater than in fellow eyes. This may be due to the impaired zonular support in pseudoexfoliation,"In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems to be more mobile in the affected eye.

10577397,The results of this study suggest that exogenous epinephrine is not necessary during SAPO.,The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.,20251021_023427_llama_baseline_N3296_gpus2

19394934,The current readiness guidelines are not sufficient for the current epidemiology of HMCIs. The guidelines should be revised to include a more accurate estimation of the number of casualties and the proportion of casualties requiring immediate medical treatment.,Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.,20251021_023427_llama_baseline_N3296_gpus2

21801416,The results of this study suggest that the intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR can affect the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion in the ewe. The effect of these drugs on the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is independent of insulin secretion and is probably mediated by the activation,"Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.",20251021_023427_llama_baseline_N3296_gpus2
