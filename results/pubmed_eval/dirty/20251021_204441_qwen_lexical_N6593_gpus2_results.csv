Our results suggest that there is a significant gap between the ideal of complete continuity of care and the reality of the current system. This may have implications for the future of surgical training.,"The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care.

26708803,Our data suggest that it is safe and effective to manage a contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach.,We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment.

10808977,Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening among women who were off-schedule during the previous year. Telephone counseling may be an effective method for increasing mammography screening among women who are not up-to-date with their screening.,"The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography.

Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.,20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
14612308,"No. PRISM does not predict LOS. An ANN can be trained to estimate LOS from PRISM data, but its performance is poor.","The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2

20101129,"Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective in the majority of patients. However, it may be cost-effective in some older women if the relative risk of a contralateral hip fracture is increased and the additional costs of the procedure are low.",": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
8916748,Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement. Employment grade and car ownership are independent predictors of mortality after retirement.,Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.,20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
22900881,The results of this study suggest that pulpotomy with MTA(®) can be considered a permanent treatment for vital pulp in premolars and molars.,"Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth.

27078715,DT is a viable alternative to NCCT for the follow-up of patients with nephrolithiasis.,"We found DT to be a comparable imaging modality to NCCT for the detection of intrarenal stones, without a significant effect from stone size and BMI and adequate reproducibility between multiple readers. DT appears to be an ideal alternative for following patients with nephrolithiasis due to its acceptable stone detection rates, low radiation exposure, and decreased cost compared to NCCT.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
12040336,Admission to a hospital with onsite revascularization services did not improve survival in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.,"In a community-based cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
15223725,There are differences between BP measured by the nurse and BP measured by the physician. These differences are clinically important and should be taken into account when evaluating BP control in treated hypertensive patients.,"Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of control of blood pressure during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2

25394614,Early surfactant administration did not reduce the incidence of CLD or mortality in this geographically defined population.,Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.,20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
21431987,The use of PET/CT did not improve the accuracy of the preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. The addition of PET/CT to conventional imaging techniques does not seem to have an impact on the therapeutic strategy.,"PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.",20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
10135926,"In-flight intubation is more difficult than intubation in the control setting. This may be due to the increased noise level, turbulence, and limited space in the helicopter.",Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 helicopter.,20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
20736887,Decompressive surgery did not improve the prognosis of spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy. Steroid therapy alone may be more effective than decompressive surgery.,The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.,20251021_204441_qwen_lexical_N6593_gpus2
