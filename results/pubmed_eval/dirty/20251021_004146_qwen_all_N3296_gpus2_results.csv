19419587,Yes. The addition of a sternal plate to wire or cable closure significantly increases sternal stability.,Transverse sternal plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.,20251021_004146_qwen_all_N3296_gpus2
14612308,No. PRISM scores correlate poorly with LOS. An ANN model trained on PRISM data does not improve prediction accuracy.,"The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",20251021_004146_qwen_all_N3296_gpus2

8916748,"Yes. Employment grade and car ownership were both associated with mortality before and after retirement. However, the association of employment grade with mortality declined after retirement whereas the association of car ownership remained stable.",Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.,20251021_004146_qwen_all_N3296_gpus2

21431987,No. The sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT for the hepatic staging. PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence and recurrence in uncommon sites.,"PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.",20251021_004146_qwen_all_N3296_gpus2
10135926,No. The in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter does not impair the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation.,Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting.
