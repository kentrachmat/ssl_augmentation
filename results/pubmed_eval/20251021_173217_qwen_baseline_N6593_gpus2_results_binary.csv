Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment.

19419587,Sternal plating improves sternal stability in a human cadaver model.,Transverse sternal plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.,20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
14612308,No.,"The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
18783922,Cytokines are present in the serum of patients with epilepsy and new onset seizures.

9100537,A swirling pattern of epithelial cells is more common in PBD than in NPBD. This finding may be useful in distinguishing PBD from NPBD.,"Because there is significant overlap in cytologic features between NPBD and PBD, the distinction between the two entities is difficult in cytologic sampling.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
20101129,"Prophylactic fixation is not cost-effective in the majority of patients. However, it may be cost-effective in some older women with a high risk of a contralateral hip fracture.",": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
8916748,Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement. Employment grade and car ownership are independent predictors of mortality after retirement.,Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.,20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
22900881,The results of this study suggest that pulpotomy with MTA(®) can be considered as a permanent treatment for vital pulp in primary molars.,"Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2

15223725,Physician-systolic BP is higher than nurse-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP. This difference is clinically important as it may lead to overtreatment.,"Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of control of blood pressure during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2

25394614,Late surfactant administration is associated with lower rates of CLD and mortality compared with early surfactant administration.,Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.,20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
21431987,The use of PET/CT does not improve the accuracy of preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. The addition of PET/CT to conventional imaging techniques does not change the therapeutic strategy in most patients.,"PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.",20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
10135926,"In-flight intubation is more difficult than intubation in the control setting. However, the difference in success rate between the two settings is not significant.",Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 helicopter.,20251021_173217_qwen_baseline_N6593_gpus2
