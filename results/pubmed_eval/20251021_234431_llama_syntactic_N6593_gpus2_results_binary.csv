10593212,No.,The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions.

15597845,The combination of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin may be a useful approach to reduce the dosages of these chemotherapeutic substances in the treatment of human ovarian cancer.,2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.,20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms.

We therefore propose the term ""functional minimally conscious state"" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value.

However, in selected patients, prophylactic fixation may be a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture.",": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.",20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2
8916748,The association between socioeconomic status and mortality is strong before retirement but declines after retirement.,Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.,20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2
22900881,Pulp chamber pulpotomy with ProRoot MTA(®)  is a reliable treatment for vital pulps in premolar and molar teeth.,"Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.",20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

27078715,DT is a viable alternative to NCCT for the follow-up of patients with nephrolithiasis.,"We found DT to be a comparable imaging modality to NCCT for the detection of intrarenal stones, without a significant effect from stone size and BMI and adequate reproducibility between multiple readers. DT appears to be an ideal alternative for following patients with nephrolithiasis due to its acceptable stone detection rates, low radiation exposure, and decreased cost compared to NCCT.",20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

15223725,The differences between NBP and PBP are clinically important and may be due to the different techniques used by the physician and the nurse. The differences between NBP and self-measured BP are not clinically important.,"Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of control of blood pressure during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients.",20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

25394614,Early surfactant administration is associated with less duration of ventilation and longer duration of CPAP but has little or no impact on CLD/mortality.,Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.,20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.",20251021_234431_llama_syntactic_N6593_gpus2

The number of casualties arriving to a single hospital is significantly lower than the current readiness guidelines. The number of casualties requiring immediate medical treatment is also lower than the current readiness guidelines. The current readiness guidelines should be revised to reflect the current threat.,Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment.
