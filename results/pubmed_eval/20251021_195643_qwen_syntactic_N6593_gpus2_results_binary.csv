15597845,The combination of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin results in an additive effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. This finding suggests that the use of 2ME in combination with these chemotherapeutic agents might be beneficial in the treatment of ovarian cancer.,2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good.

Telephone counseling may be an effective method for increasing mammography screening among women who are not up-to-date with their screening.,"The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening.
